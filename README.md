## 🏗️ Modular Architecture

The system uses a plugin-based architecture for easy extensibility:

### Core Components
- **`analysis/base.py`** - Abstract base classes and registry system
- **`modular_analyzer.py`** - Main orchestrator using plugin architecture  
- **`dashboard_generator.py`** - Interactive HTML dashboard generator with real-time controls

### Analysis Modules (Plugins)
- **`analysis/performance.py`** - Algorithmic efficiency evaluation
- **`analysis/readability.py`** - Code clarity and maintainability assessment
- **`analysis/requirements_traceability.py`** - Requirements compliance and traceability matrix
- **`analysis/code_quality.py`** - Best practices and error handling analysis
- **`analysis/documentation.py`** - Documentation quality evaluation
- **`analysis/security.py`** - Security practices and vulnerability assessment
- **`analysis/adaptability.py`** - Solution flexibility and configurability analysis

## 🔧 How It Works

The modular analyzer:

1. **Discovers analysis modules** using the plugin registry system
2. **Reads all solution files** (.ps1, .bat, .md, etc.) from each LLM folder
3. **Runs each enabled analyzer** with configurable weights
4. **Aggregates scores** using weighted methodology
5. **Generates multiple output formats** (Markdown, CSV, JSON, HTML)
6. **Creates interactive dashboards** with Chart.js visualizations

class YourCustomAnalyzer(BaseAnalyzer):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="Your Custom Analysis",
            description="Description of what your analyzer evaluates",
            weight=0.15  # 15% of total score
        )
    
    def analyze(self, files, llm_name, prompt_requirements):
        # Your custom analysis logic here
        score = 85.0  # Calculate your score
        notes = ["Your analysis findings and reasoning"]
        return AnalysisScore(score=score, notes=notes)

# Usage example:
workspace_path = r"your\workspace\path"
analyzer = ModularLLMAnalyzer(workspace_path)
analyzer.registry.register(YourCustomAnalyzer())
results = analyzer.analyze_all_solutions()
```
